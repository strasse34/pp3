# My To Do List
It is a python command-line interface app which runs in Code Institute mock terminal in Heroku. Users can keep their tasks with date, time, title and a short note through this app. The data is stored in a google sheet which has already been integrated with the app.<br>

#How does it work?
It is supper easy. App gets required information step by step. It instructs and helps users to add their information easily. If you are new user, you open an account and then start adding event/tasks. It takes about 1 minute to add one single event and save it. When you come next time, you just need to log in with your username and possword and then see what are upcomming events/tasks. Then you can exit or add a new task.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
